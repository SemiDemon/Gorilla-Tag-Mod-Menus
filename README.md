# Gorilla-Tag-Mod-Menus
Hey guys! Im rizz (rizz#9801)
I am an expierenced developer with Unity, and coding with Lua and Java.
If you have any questions, please DM me on Discord. (user above)
I also have a modding server right here! https://discord.gg/UpfyW3tg
Also, please ONLY use these menus in a private modded lobby, as you will most likely get banned for it. This applies for ALL menus listed.
Most menus are illegal, so ONLY USE THEM IN PRIVATE MODDED LOBBIES!
I will be listing some legal mods, just not mod menus, as the only legal mod menu is the Haunted Mod Menu, which is set default inside of the Monke Mod Manager.exe file.
If you have any questions, again, please just DM me on Discord. You can easily find me in my Discord server, so join that.
I am mostly active unless I am in school, so expect a DM from me very soon. 
I am in EST or ET time depending on daylight savings, so yeah.
Have fun!
